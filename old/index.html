<p> NOTE: You must have a Java enabled browser e.g. <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape 32-bit</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Internet Explorer</a> to view the above applet.  
If your browser does not support Java, or you have enable Java applets turned off in your preferences, there will be a static graphic saying &quot;you need java&quot;, or
nothing between the two horizontal separator lines above.

<p>This demo demonstrates a possible solution to the classic <strong>Traveling Salesman Problem.</strong>
It attempts to find the shortest round-trip connecting the set of cities that a salesman must visit.  
It places about a hundred cities at random points in the applet's area, and then uses the 
<strong>simulated annealing</strong> algorithm to estimate the shortest path.  
The status bar of your browser should be continuously updated with the current total path length as well as the Temperature.  
More on the temperature later.  When the applet has finished, it will display the text &quot;DONE:&quot; in the status bar 
followed by the final path length.  Click on the [Refresh] or [Reload] button in your browser to start the applet over.  
The applet slows down the action by including a delay between steps.

<p> Well, that's my <strong>token Java applet</strong> for my web-page.  If you want someone to do <b>Java
programming</b> for you, I may be your man.  Personally I love the language, and am encouraged
by how popular it has become.  All languages have their advantages and disadvantages, but
Java is more elegant, safer, and more portable than most.
